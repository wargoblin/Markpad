# Releasing Markpad

This document is the maintainer-facing runbook for cutting a Markpad release with auto-update enabled. Auto-update is wired through [`tauri-plugin-updater`](https://v2.tauri.app/plugin/updater/), which verifies signed update bundles using [minisign](https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/).

## One-time setup (do once, before the first auto-update-capable release)

### 1. Generate the signing keypair

On your local machine, in the Markpad checkout:

```bash
npm run tauri signer generate -- -w ~/.tauri/markpad-updater.key
```

You'll be prompted for a password. **Pick a strong one and store it together with the private key in your password manager.** The command produces two files:

- `~/.tauri/markpad-updater.key`     — **PRIVATE**. Never commit. Never share. Back up to a password manager.
- `~/.tauri/markpad-updater.key.pub` — **PUBLIC**. Shared with developers; ends up shipped inside Markpad.

### 2. Add Secrets to `alecdotdev/Markpad`

In the GitHub repo settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret:

| Name                                  | Value                                              |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`           | full content of `~/.tauri/markpad-updater.key`     |
| `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD`  | the password you set in step 1                     |

The build workflow reads both at signing time on macOS, Windows, and Linux runners.

### 3. Send the public key content

Send the **single-line content** of `~/.tauri/markpad-updater.key.pub` (no comments, no header lines) to the developer who'll commit it to `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` under `plugins.updater.pubkey`. Until that placeholder is replaced, auto-update is inert — the app surfaces a clean error state instead of contacting the update server.

### 4. CRITICAL: the pubkey is permanent

Once a release ships with the pubkey embedded, **it cannot be rotated** without breaking auto-update for every existing user. Rotation means everyone re-installs Markpad manually. Treat the keypair as a long-lived release secret.

If you ever lose the private key:

- Existing users can still use Markpad, but they will not auto-update again.
- A new keypair has to be generated, embedded in a new release, and that release has to be installed manually by every user.
- Communicate this in release notes so users aren't blindsided.

## Per-release workflow

1. **Bump version in both files** (mandatory — Tauri reads runtime version from `Cargo.toml`):
   - [`package.json`](package.json) `version`
   - [`src-tauri/Cargo.toml`](src-tauri/Cargo.toml) `[package].version`
2. **Commit, tag, push:**
   ```bash
   git commit -am "chore: bump version to X.Y.Z"
   git tag vX.Y.Z
   git push origin master vX.Y.Z
   ```
3. **Trigger the workflow:**
   - GitHub UI: Actions → "Build and Release" → Run workflow → master
   - Or CLI: `gh workflow run build.yml --ref master`
4. **Wait** ~30 min for matrix builds to finish, plus ~2 min for `generate-update-feed`.
5. **Open the draft release** on the [Releases page](https://github.com/alecdotdev/Markpad/releases). Verify the assets:
   - **macOS**: `*.dmg`, `*.app.tar.gz`, `*.app.tar.gz.sig`
   - **Windows x64**: `*_x64.exe`, `*_x64-setup.nsis.zip`, `*_x64-setup.nsis.zip.sig`
   - **Windows ARM64**: `*_arm64.exe`, `*_arm64-setup.nsis.zip`, `*_arm64-setup.nsis.zip.sig`
   - **Linux**: `*.deb`, `*.rpm`, `*.AppImage`, `*.AppImage.tar.gz`, `*.AppImage.tar.gz.sig`
   - **Update feed**: `latest.json` (one entry per successfully built platform)
6. **Click "Publish release"** — this is the gate that activates auto-update for all clients pointing at `releases/latest/download/latest.json`.

## First auto-update-capable release

The first release after auto-update is enabled does **not** auto-update existing users — older Markpad builds don't have the updater wiring yet. They must download and install this version manually once. From then on, every subsequent release reaches users automatically.

Mention this clearly in the release notes for the first auto-update-capable version, e.g.:

> This release activates in-app auto-updates. **Install it manually one last time** — future releases will update Markpad on their own.

## Coverage notes

- **macOS** uses one universal binary (`darwin-aarch64` + `darwin-x86_64` share the same `.app.tar.gz` and signature).
- **Windows** uses NSIS (`*.nsis.zip`). The existing raw `.exe` distribution path is preserved alongside, so users who download `.exe` directly continue to work; only the auto-updater path uses NSIS bundles.
- **Linux**: only `AppImage` users get auto-updates — `tauri-plugin-updater` doesn't support `.deb` or `.rpm`. `apt`/`rpm` users keep getting updates via their distro package manager (or by downloading a fresh package).
- **Snap / Chocolatey**: independent distribution channels. Their update mechanisms are unaffected.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause / fix |
|---------|---------------------|
| Build fails: "missing `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`" | Step 2 of one-time setup wasn't done, or Secret name doesn't match. |
| `generate-update-feed` succeeds but `latest.json` lacks a platform | That platform's matrix build failed silently (or the `.sig` file wasn't produced). Check the failed build's logs. |
| `latest.json` missing entirely | The `generate-update-feed` job didn't run — usually because no `*.sig` files were uploaded. Check the `Upload * Artifacts` steps. |
| Users don't see the update | (1) Did you click *Publish release*? Drafts aren't visible to clients. (2) Is the user on a version older than the first auto-update-capable release? They need a one-time manual reinstall. |
| Update download succeeds but install fails with signature error | Pubkey mismatch — the Secrets and `tauri.conf.json` `pubkey` belong to different keypairs. |

## Out of scope (not handled by this workflow)

- **Apple Developer ID code-signing & notarization** — `.app` bundles are unsigned. macOS may show a Gatekeeper warning on first launch. Minisign verification by the updater is independent of Apple code-signing.
- **Windows Authenticode signing** — `.exe` and `.nsis.zip` are not signed with a code-signing certificate. Users may see a SmartScreen warning. Minisign verification is independent.
- **Retroactive signing** of older releases.
